A **notification** provides information about a sent message.

Each notification has:

- **id**: Identifier of the related message.
- **from**: Notification originator’s address. A notification may be generated by the server (`postmaster@msging.net`) or by the final customer, depending on the **event**.
- **to**: Notification recipient’s address. 
- **event**: Event related to the message. The recipient’s events depend on the channel and they may not be available. The valid values are: 
  * **accepted**: The message has been accepted by the server.
  * **dispatched**: The message has left the server and was dispatched to recipient.
  * **received**: The recipient has received the message.
  * **consumed**: The recipient has read the message.
  * **failed**: The message has failed. In this case, the property **reason** must be present. 
- **reason** – In case of `failed` events, represents the reason of the message failure. It contains the following properties:
  * **code** – Failure numeric code. This value is mandatory.
  * **description** – Failure description message.
