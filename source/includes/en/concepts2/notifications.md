A **notification** provides information about a sent message.


<aside class="warning"> Every notification needs to be sent through your unique HTTP endpoint. You can find this information by accessing you Chatbot, going to <strong>Configurations menu</strong> and then <strong>Connection information.</strong><br><br>Remember to replace {{contract_id}}* with your id!<br><br>*The contract_id value can be identified as being part of your URL, in the following format:  https://{{contract_id}}.http.msging.net/notifications<br><br><img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/z3gw0tg4yairh7q/imagem%20docs%202.png?dl=1"></aside>


Each notification has:

- **id**: Identifier of the related message.
- **from**: Notification originator's address. A notification may be generated by the server (`postmaster@msging.net`) or by the final customer, depending on the **event**.
- **to**: Notification's recipient address. 
- **event**: Event related to the message. The recipient's events depend on the channel and may not be available. The valid values are: 
  * **accepted**: The message has been accepted by the server.
  * **dispatched**: The message has left the server and was dispatched to recipient.
  * **received**: The recipient has received the message.
  * **consumed**: The recipient has read the message.
  * **failed**: The message has failed. In this case, the property **reason** must be present. 
- **reason**: In case of `failed` events, it represents the reason of the message failure. It contains the following properties:
  * **code**: The failure's numeric code. This value is mandatory.
  * **description**: Failure's description message.

For more details, check the [LIME protocol](http://limeprotocol.org/index.html#notification) specification.
