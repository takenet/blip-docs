### Sending notifications

In order to correctly show the message history, it is important that the chatbots send notifications of messages processed to originator clients.

For each message processed, a notification must be sent with the consumed event. In case of problems, the chatbot must send a notification with the failed event.

### Receiving notifications

<blockquote class="lang-specific javascript">
<p>The next sample shows how to add a notification receiver with filter to the `received` event type:</p>
</blockquote>

```javascript
client.addNotificationReceiver("received", function(notification) {
  // Process received notifications
});

// Using expression lambda
client.addNotificationReceiver(() => true, function(message) {
  // Process received notifications
});
```

<blockquote class="lang-specific python">
<p>The next sample shows how to add a notification receiver with filter to the `received` event type:</p>
</blockquote>

```python
def notification_processor(notification: Notification) -> None:
    # Process received notifications
    pass

client.add_notification_receiver(Receiver(lambda n: n.event == 'received', notification_processor))
```

<blockquote class="lang-specific csharp">
<p>The receipt of notifications is done using the interface INotificationReceiver.</p>
</blockquote>

```csharp
public class ConsumedNotificationReceiver : INotificationReceiver
{
    public async Task ReceiveAsync(Notification notification, CancellationToken cancellationToken)
    {
        // Write the received notification to the console
        Console.WriteLine(notification.ToString());
    }
}
```

<blockquote class="lang-specific http">
<p>All notifications will be delivered as a HTTP POST request on the configured URL for chatbot notifications.</p>
</blockquote>

```http
POST https://your.endpoint/notifications HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "id": "123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426655440000",
  "from": "551100001111@0mn.io/4ac58r6e3",
  "to": "blipmessaginghubapp@msging.net/7a8fr233x",
  "event": "received"
}
```
Each notification contains the status of messages. Observe that the notifications are sent by the clients, informing if they received some message or not.
