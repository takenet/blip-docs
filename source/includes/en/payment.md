### Payment Channels

In order to allow the bot owner to charge for their services, there are integrations with **payment channels**, such as *PagSeguro* (a Brazilian payment gateway).

**Payment channels** are integrations with payment suppliers connected to **Blip**. In these channels, contacts may receive/send payment from/to customers. Each channel has one identifier that is used in the addressing, located before the `@` of the address.

In order to receive or send payments to a channel, contacts must be configured on it. Configuration is made through the portal, where some specific channel information, such as the APIs’ **tokens**, will be requested. It is necessary to fulfill a previous registration form on each channel, normally through the supplier’s site.
